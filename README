# Approach
# Task Management API

The Task Management API is designed to allow users to manage their tasks efficiently. The core features include user registration, authentication, and CRUD operations for tasks. The API is built using Node.js and Sequelize ORM for database interactions.

### Key Features
- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can register and log in to manage their tasks securely with JWT authentication.
- **Task Management**: Users can create, read, update, and delete their tasks. Tasks can be filtered by status, priority, and due date, and searched by title or description.
- **Pagination**: The API supports pagination for task lists to improve performance.

### Assumptions
- Users must have a valid account to access the task management features.
- Data validation is implemented to ensure that the required fields are provided.
- The application is built for a single user context; multi-user support can be added if needed.
